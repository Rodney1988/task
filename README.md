# Star Wars challenge

Star Wars Universe was originally built on [CodeSandBox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/Rodney1988/challenge "Open via CodeSandbox"). I worked on CodeSandBox initially to save time / due to technical Issues setting up my private PC to GitHub.

On the main directory, run: 'npm run start'.
This will run the react app on localhost:3000.

The idea of this Web Application is that it allows the user to navigate through different Star War resources and have fun learning about the Star Wars Universe.

You are allowed to select different resource types and check out the respective resource details.

The fake credentials - User: 'tester', Pw: 'admin'

The Application is built using React, Material-UI, Axios + React Query, and the [SWAPI API](https://swapi.dev/ "navigate to the API").
